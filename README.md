R/a/dio on the go, finally! With this app you can listen to the stream
with a dedicated app! You may request songs, check up on the latest
news, browse the last played songs + queue and most importantly, tune
in!

R/a/dio is a website that was founded 7+ years ago with the intention
of bringing you a stream of (mostly) high quality anime music, and we
keep that up to this day! You can always drop by and visit our website
https://r-a-d.io for more robust features as well as reading up on
everything.

The app will continuously improve. If there are any bugs please report
it here, or on the site.

As always, thanks for listening!

Gato-goto choo-choo!
